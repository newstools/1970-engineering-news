South Africa&#39;s Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has the full backing of cabinet as he faces charges that, while running the tax agency, he fraudulently approved early retirement for a deputy, Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe said on Thursday. Gordhan is &quot;innocent until proven otherwise by a court of law,&quot; Radebe told reporters. Gordhan has also been added to a inter-ministerial task team analysing university fees following protests by students over the cost of higher education, Radebe said.
