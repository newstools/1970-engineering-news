The retail price of petrol will go up by 45 cents a litre for both 93 octane and 95 octane on Wednesday, November 2, South Africa&rsquo;s energy department announced on Friday. Diesel rises by 63 cents a litre, while the wholesale price of illuminating paraffin increases by 57 cents a litre, the department said in a statement. The maximum retail price of LPGas goes up by 59 cents a kilogramme. The department attributed the hikes to, among others, the increase in the prices of petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin in the international markets, as well as the increase in the price of crude oil.
