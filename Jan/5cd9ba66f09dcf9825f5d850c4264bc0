The City of Tshwane&rsquo;s free WiFi project, TshWi-Fi, made possible by telecommunications service provider Project Isizwe, has won a Wi-Fi NOW award for affordable connectivity. &nbsp; Delivering free WiFi to more than two-million citizens in South Africa&#39;s capital city, Pretoria, TshWi-Fi is the biggest deployment of its kind on the African continent with over 1 000 WiFi hotspots. &nbsp; By creating the largest free-to-the-public WiFi service in Africa, TshWi-Fi has positioned Tshwane as the most connected city on the continent. The project has facilitated over 2.2-million unique connections and over 133-million sessions, using 2.6 petabytes of data.
