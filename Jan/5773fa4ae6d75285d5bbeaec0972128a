Aerial and underwater drones, as well as track-and-trace technology to track port assets such as tugs and dredgers, have been piloted successfully at the Port of Durban. This pilot project formed part of the Transnet National Ports Authority&rsquo;s plans to roll out smart ports. The proof of concept exercise showed that drones can be used in a number of ways, including for the inspection of infrastructure and the condition of the sea bed, which can be done safely without interrupting port operations. The drone technology can also assist in collecting information on port traffic. Sensor technology provides port and terminal performance management data, including capacity use, berth occupancy, port limit access and civilian count during surveillance and security management. Speaking at the African Ports Evolution 2016 conference this week, TNPA Port of Durban services manager Ristha Joga said a smart port would result in an efficient data-rich and information-rich ecosystem connecting port assets, employees, terminal operators and the port community including road and rail. &ldquo;It will also help the ports to achieve a more focused customer-centric technology that will reduce the latency of information sharing and result in a more informed decision-making process.&rdquo; The port has also introduced a mobile app designed to streamline the reporting of complaints and issues, while ensuring improved accountability, transparency and communication with port stakeholders, users, government and the community. Smart meters converted analogue information to digital data for electricity and water metering.&nbsp; Further, three-dimensional printing was explored to make port and precinct modelling easier for port planning and development projects.
