The 86 MW Prieska solar photovoltaic (PV) project, in the Northern Cape, has been officially inaugurated, having entered commercial operation in July. The plant has been developed by the Mulilo Sonnedix joint venture and was opened at the end of October by Sonnedix CEO Andreas Mustad and Mulilo CEO Johnny Cullum. Mustad reports that the plant is the largest in Sonnedix&rsquo;s global solar PV fleet, which spans nine countries and 66 individual plants. Situated 50 km south-west of the town of Prieska, the project is located on a 125-ha site. It required over 1.6-million person-hours to build and Cullum reports that more than half of the 1 720 construction workers were drawn from local communities. Construction began on April 28, 2015, with juwi Solar ZA Construction as the engineering, procurement and construction partner.
