President Jacob Zuma is due to answer Members of Parliament (MPs) in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) on Tuesday, where he is expected to face questions on Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and a looming economic downgrade. Zuma missed his quarterly appearance in the NCOP last term, making Tuesday&#39;s appearance his first since the local elections concluded in August. Democratic Alliance (DA) MP Willem Faber will ask the president about his position on the country&#39;s economic stability given the ongoing investigation into Gordhan. African National Congress (ANC) MP Boingotlo Nthebe will ask what influence the ratings agencies&#39; negative outlook for South Africa will have on future trade agreements with other countries. Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) MP Mntomuhle Khawula wants to know if the Presidency is still considering moving the seat of Parliament from Cape Town to Pretoria, as suggested in Zuma&#39;s State of the Nation address in February. DA MP Bronwynn Engelbrecht will ask why Dudu Myeni was reappointed to the position of SAA chairperson despite the airline losing R5.6-billion in 2014/15. ANC MP Tekoetsile Motlashuping will ask Zuma what the advantages were in establishing the Presidential State-Owned Enterprises Coordinating Council, which effectively put Zuma in charge of all of the country&#39;s SOEs. Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande meanwhile is also due to appear before Parliament on Tuesday. Nzimande is set to update the National Assembly on the current crisis engulfing universities across the country, following weeks of renewed Fees Must Fall protests.
