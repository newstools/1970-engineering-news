Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies has welcomed the R120-million investment by US-based multinational 3M to expand its operations in South Africa. 3M is a science and technology company that produces thousands of products, including consumer, safety and graphics, electronics and energy, healthcare and industrial products. Davies said the investment is a major boost for the manufacturing sector as the enhancement is designed to improve productivity and will position the Maple Park plant, in Pomona, Kempton Park, as one of 3M&rsquo;s globally competitive locations. &ldquo;Such investment is important and demonstrates the confidence that 3M has in the long-term future of South Africa as a regional manufacturing hub,&rdquo; he noted. 3M South Africa MD Ismail Mapara said the investment in manufacturing and the creation of new jobs complements and adds to the company&rsquo;s history in South Africa. &ldquo;Our $500 000 automotive-line investment offers 3M customers the high-quality products and service they expect, but with even more agility now that we are able to manufacture our film products for the industry with only a to-scale drawing of the vehicle,&rdquo; he added. He further pointed out that the fully automated scourer production line comprises bespoke equipment tailor-made for the South African market and was built in the country with the support of local and international 3M engineers. 3M is employing experienced resources from within the industry while developing skills among new employees. The new investment in Maple Park will create an additional 75 jobs, with more opportunities arising across the company as a result of the expansion of 3M&rsquo;s domestic operations.
