Agriculture products and services provider NWK MD Danie Marais will retire early next year, the company said on Friday. The process of filling the position of CEO started some time ago and the position has already been advertised. An appointment will be made as soon as a suitable candidate is found. &ldquo;With this in mind, Marais requested the NWK board to reschedule his retirement to an earlier date. Following the board&rsquo;s approval, his request to step down at the end of November will be accommodated,&rdquo; noted chairperson Heinrich Kr&uuml;ger. The board thanked Marais for his contribution to the company over the past nine years. Until the position of CEO is filled, FD Theo Rabe will fill the role in an acting capacity.
