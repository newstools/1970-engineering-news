The amount of money which South Africa&#39;s MTN Group is alleged to have illegally moved out of Nigeria is &quot;mind boggling&quot;, a Nigerian lawmaker said on Thursday. &quot;It is not what we can sweep under the carpet. We intend to get to the bottom of the fact, all of the fact, nothing but the fact,&quot; said Olusola Adeyeye, a senator, reading out a statement from Senate leader Bukola Saraki. He did not specify what the alleged amount might be. He spoke at the start of a parliamentary hearing to investigate accusations that MTN transferred at least $14-billion out of Nigeria without observing the country&#39;s laws. The company has denied this.
