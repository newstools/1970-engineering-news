ABU DHABI &ndash; Guinea opened a new container terminal on Wednesday, part of a bauxite complex being developed in the West African country by Abu Dhabi investment fund Mubadala. Mubadala signed a $5-billion agreement with Guinea in 2013 to develop a bauxite mine, alumina refinery and a port in Guinea to secure raw material for the United Arab Emirate&#39;s aluminium plants. The terminal in the new port of Kamsar will be used by the complex as well as by third parties as an alternative to container facilities in Conakry. &ldquo;This project remains an important milestone for my development programme for Guinea,&rdquo; President Alpha Conde said in a statement. Guinea has around seven billion tonnes of bauxite resources, over a quarter of the global total, the statement said. Guinea Alumina Corporation&#39;s (GAC) mine is in the Boke region of north-west Guinea, which holds over one-billion tonnes of bauxite. Commercial production at the mine is expected to begin in 2018. GAC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Emirates Global Aluminium.
