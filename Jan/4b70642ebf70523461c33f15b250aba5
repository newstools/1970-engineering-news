Hyprop Investments&rsquo; 60%-owned UK-based subsidiary Hystead has acquired Skopje City Mall, in Macedonia, south-east Europe, from Balfin Finance for &euro;92-million. Hystead, in which PDI Investment has the remaining 40% stake, now owns three properties in the region, in line with Hyprop&rsquo;s Europe strategy. &ldquo;Our objective is to own a high-quality shopping centre portfolio in south-east Europe. Macedonia is a small, open economy which has taken great strides to strengthen its economy over the last decade,&rdquo; said Hypop CEO Pieter Prinsloo. The 37 600 m&sup2; Skopje City Mall, the largest in the country since opening its doors in 2012, is located in the capital city of Skopje, which has a population of 534 000 people in a country with real gross domestic product growth of 3.3% forecast for 2017. &ldquo;Skopje City Mall&rsquo;s high occupancy, promising footfall, balanced tenant mix and expansion opportunities ensure that it is an attractive investment,&rdquo; noted Prinsloo.
