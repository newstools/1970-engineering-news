The World Bank has increased its 2017 price outlook for both metals and oil in its latest &lsquo;Commodity Markets Outlook&rsquo;, raising its October forecast for crude oil to $55/bl, from $53/bl in July. It has, however, sustained its forecast for an average oil price of $43/bl in 2016. Energy prices, which include oil, natural gas and coal, are projected to jump almost 25% overall next year, with coal prices expected to average $58/t in 2016, despite a 30% surge in thermal coal prices during third quarter of 2016. The recent increase in coal prices to above $65/t was attributed to strong demand and tightening supply in China as a result of government restrictions on production and adverse weather conditions. However, the bank expects coal prices to reduce during 2017 on the back of supply additions and weak demand. &ldquo;China&rsquo;s coal policy will be key, given that the country consumes half of the world&rsquo;s coal output and coal accounts for nearly two-thirds of the country&rsquo;s energy consumption.&rdquo; Metals prices are projected to rise more sharply in 2017 than forecast in July, as a result of faster-than-expected mine closures. Metals prices rose by 4% in the third quarter, the second consecutive quarterly gain, on supply constraints, strong demand and falling stocks. &ldquo;Iron ore, nickel, tin and zinc have risen by more than 20% over the past two quarters on various supply shortfalls, while the two largest consumed metals&mdash;aluminum and copper&mdash;have seen more modest gains on ample supply and rising capacity,&rdquo; the bank stated. Zinc prices recorded the strongest gains in 2016, rising 50% from January to September, owing to ongoing supply tightness as a result of mine closures and voluntary production cuts, amidst strong steel demand. &ldquo;In 2017 metals prices are projected to increase by 4% as most markets continue to rebalance. The largest gain is for zinc, which is projected to rise more than 20%, on continued supply tightening from large mine closures.&rdquo; Meanwhile, precious metals prices, which rose 8% in the third quarter on strong investment demand and safe-haven buying, have increased by more than 20% this year. Silver led the way, surging 16%, on strong investor and industrial demand, followed by platinum, up 8%, on South African rand appreciation and tightening physical supply. Gold prices lagged these increases, but nevertheless rose 6% to average $1 335/oz. &ldquo;Precious metals prices are projected to rise 7% in 2016, mainly due to stronger investment demand,&rdquo; the bank said.
