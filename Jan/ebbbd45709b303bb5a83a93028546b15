South Africa&#39;s State prosecutor will hold a media briefing on Monday, his office said in a statement, amid speculation that fraud charges against finance minister Pravin Gordhan may be dropped after a review. The briefing would start at 0830 GMT, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said without giving details. NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku did not answer calls to his mobile or landline. State prosecutor Shaun Abrahams said on Sunday he had yet to decide whether to proceed with the charges against Gordhan and two co-accused. Gordhan, business leaders, the opposition and several senior figures in the ruling African National Congress (ANC) have dismissed the charges as frivolous and politically motivated. The charges against Gordhan, who is widely respected in financial markets, have also weighed on South Africa&#39;s currency and government bonds.
