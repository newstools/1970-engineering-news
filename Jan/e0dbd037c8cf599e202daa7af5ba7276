South Africa needs to import more than two-million tonnes of maize in 2016/17 as a severe drought hits farm output, although exports of certain fruits and beef have remained resilient, the National Treasury said on Wednesday. The worst drought in a century has scorched farm lands in Africa&rsquo;s most industrialized country, affecting some 2.7-million households and pushing up food prices as five provinces were declared disaster areas. &ldquo;Exports of certain fruits, nuts and beef products have remained resilient, supported by the weaker rand, global demand and market diversification,&rdquo; said the National Treasury in documents presented at parliament during Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan&rsquo;s three-year budget outlook.
